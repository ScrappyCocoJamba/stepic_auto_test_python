I've had some troubles with yearly-statistic dashboard. 
My commits were not shown on this dashboard. I found a problem and 
solved it. `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` were wrong
for my git account. Although I use IDE PyCharm by JetBrains and I've been
connected from UI my wrong credentials have been used.
